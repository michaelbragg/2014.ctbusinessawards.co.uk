COVENTRY and Warwickshire firms which are defying the doom and gloom and delivering success, will have the chance to shine under the spotlight once again at the region’s most prestigious accolades.
Today, we are launching the Coventry TelegraphBusiness Awards 2014 – celebrating companies which have not only weathered the recent economic storm, but have achieved success for themselves, their staff and their customers.

Telegraph editor Alun Thorne said:

&ldquo;We are always
overwhelmed by the fantastic response we get for the business awards - both in terms of entries and the numbers that attend on the night - but I also think it is important that we continue to evolve the event to keep its as fresh as possible while maintaining its focus on celebrating the fantastic achievements of businesses across Coventry and Warwickshire.&rdquo;

&ldquo;That’s why I am thrilled to have secured the city’s majestic cathedral as the venue for this year’s event which is one of the Midlands most stunning buildings and will provide a completely unique experience for everybody.&rdquo;
