The Coventry Telegraph Business Awards are absolutely vital for our local economy, claim judges on this year’s panel.

According to Coventry City Council executive director Martin Yardley – who is one of five leading professionals who will be choosing this year’s prestigious winners – the accolades signal a ‘flourishing business community’.

His comments come as the panel prepares for the gruelling task of shortlisting three companies in each category, before selecting an overall winner for this year’s 20th annual awards.

And as the deadline looms, firms are running out of time to enter the
event - which this year will be held at Coventry Cathedral
on June 20. Companies have until Friday, May 2, to submit their application before judging takes place on May 16.

This year’s panel will be led by Coventry Telegraph editor Alun Thorne.
He is joined by Mr Yardley, who is also chief executive of the Coventry and Warwickshire Local Enterprise Partnership - a key driver for economic growth in the area, influencing or placing more than £100million of spending into the local economy.

As executive director of Place, Mr Yardley manages around 2,000 council employees covering areas as diverse as bin collections, highways, transport, planning and parks and open spaces. The directorate is also leading the regeneration of the city, particularly the city centre, working with private sector developers to transform the city centre and create a new business district at Friargate.

He is a chartered town planner by profession with a specialist interest in how planning can enable economic growth and development. He also has a Master’s in business administration from the University of Warwick.

“The Coventry Telegraph business awards are absolutely vital for our local economy,” he said. “They signal a flourishing business community that’s increasingly confident about the future here, and they give us
all a great opportunity to celebrate all that’s good about business in the area.

“I’m really looking forward to finding out more about some of the best businesses around as a judge in the awards, and I’m looking forward to the awards ceremony itself as a day when we can all feel a lot of pride
in what we do here, and what we will go on to do in the future.”
Our third judge is David Bailey - professor of Industrial Strategy at the Aston Business School and a visiting professor at Coventry University.

He has written extensively on economic restructuring and industrial and regional policy, especially in relation to manufacturing and the auto industry. He has been a regular columnist and blogger for the Coventry Telegraph and Birmingham Post. He was also chairman of the Regional Studies Association over 2006-12 and is now an honorary vice-chairman and an editor of the association’s flagship journal Regional Studies.

He said: “I’m really looking forward to this year’s Coventry Telegraph Business Awards. They celebrate the very heart of our dynamic city’s economy.

“It is brilliant to hear more about the best firms locally - the ones that create jobs, innovate, export and help rebalance the economy. We’re looking for the brightest and the best in business.”

David Grindrod, acting director at the University of Warwick Science Park, is our fourth judge. For the last ten years he has had a specific
responsibility for its business support activities and innovation centres.
Prior to that he was COO of a UMIST spin out that had developed an Electronic Nose and director of a semiconductor capital.
