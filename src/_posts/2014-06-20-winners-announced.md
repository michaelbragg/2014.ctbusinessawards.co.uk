The Coventry Telegraph's 20<sup>th</sup> annual Business Awards saw more than 400 leading professionals from across the region gather for one of the most prestigious events in the business calendar.

And the event has once again underlined the many outstanding businesses we have across Coventry and Warwickshire. Louise Bennett, chief executive of the Coventry and Warwickshire Chamber of Commerce, said: &ldquo;We are delighted, once again, to have been part of such a great night – celebrating all that is good about the business community in Coventry and Warwickshire.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Once again, the event put the spotlight on the wonderful range of businesses we have here on our patch – from service providers to manufacturers and from small companies up to major international names.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Huge congratulations from everyone at the Chamber goes to those businesses who won their awards and may they be an inspiration to other companies across Coventry and Warwickshire.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I know it was a really tough decision for the judges this year and to be shortlisted was an achievement in itself against some very strong competition. So those firms should be proud of their achievements too.&rdquo;

&ldquo;It all goes to prove what a great place Coventry and Warwickshire is to do business and underlines the many outstanding companies we have based here.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Let’s look forward to another successful 12 months and hopefully next year will see the bar raised even further still for this superb celebration of business in Coventry and Warwickshire.&rdquo;
