The judges have made their decision and the finalists for the 2014 Coventry Telegraph Business Awards can today be revealed.

After hours of looking through more than a hundred entries for this year’s accolades, our expert panel have selected the shortlisted businesses for each of the nine categories.

And the overall winners will be announced at this year’s glittering gala at Coventry Cathedral on June 20.

Coventry Telegraph editor Alun Thorne said: “I can genuinely say that this is the strongest year yet in terms of entries for the business awards. What is so pleasing is to see dozens of companies, not just surviving in these still challenging times, but positively thriving.

“Now that the judging is complete we are now looking forward to an excellent night on June 20 when I am determined that we will set a new benchmark for an event of this kind and I would urge everybody to come and join us.”
