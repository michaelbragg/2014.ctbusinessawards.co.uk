<p>The Awards are open to all companies and organisations with a significant presence within the Coventry and Warwickshire Region. However, applications will also be considered from businesses based on the fringe of the Coventry and Warwickshire area, as long as a significant interest within the area can be demonstrated, eg customer base, workforce, etc.</p>

<p>The Awards will assign a judging panel with an appropriate Chairperson. Every effort will be  made to give feedback to entrants, although no specific  correspondence will be entered into. The decision of the judging  panel for each Award and on all associated matters is  final.</p>
